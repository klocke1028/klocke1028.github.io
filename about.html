            <p>
                I am a Northeast Ohio based full-stack software development student at We Can Code IT. I made the decision to jump into the tech field <br>
                in early 2024 because while I have a bachelor's degree in communication studies, I was wanting to find a career path that I was more passionate about.<br>
                I've always had a love for technology, especially computers and gaming so I decided to take an introductory course to test the waters. I ended up loving <br>
                it and enrolled in WCCI's full-time summer cohort for full-stack Java development. I've found that I really enjoy front-end development during my time as <br>
                a student. I love that it can allow me to be creative in order to design both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly layouts.<br>
                In my free time you can find me either playing music, gaming, or spending time with my husband and four cats. <br>
