        <p>
            I am a Northeast Ohio based full-stack software development student at We Can Code IT. <br>
            I made the decision to jump into the tech field in early 2024 because while I have a bachelor's degree <br> 
            in communication studies, I was wanting to find a career path that I was more passionate about.<br>
            I've always had a love for technology, especially computers and gaming so I decided to take an introductory <br>
            course to test the waters. I ended up loving it and enrolled in WCCI's full-time summer cohort for full-stack Java <br>
            development. I've found that I really enjoy front-end development during my time as a student. I love that it <br>
            can allow me to be creative in order to design both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly layouts.<br>
