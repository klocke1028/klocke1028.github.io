          Virtual Pet 1 was my first experience with building a simple
          application. Using Java <br />
          fundamentals, I was able to create a virtual pet in which I could
          feed, water and play with. <br />
          preforming these tasks would in turn affect the pet's stats. <br />
          <br />
          Virtual Pet 1 was written in Visual Studio Code using basic concepts
          such as loops, <br />
          methods, and classes. <br />

          Virtual Pet 2 was built off of Virtual Pet 1. Here I added a shelter
          class where I could house <br />
          and care for multiple pets as opposed to just one. I also added
          methods which allowed for adopting out <br />
          and admitting pets to and from the shelter. <br />
          <br />
          Virtual Pet 2 was written in Visual Studio Code and introduced the use
          of new concepts from OOP and using collections.

          Virtual Pet API is a simple REST API. Here I created an entity,
          repository, controller and service <br />
          for virtual pets. Pets were able to be loaded into and located in the
          database. <br />
          <br />
          Like Virtual Pet 1 and 2, this project was written in Visual Studio
          Code. The project was created via <br />
          Spring Initializer and tested using Postman. <br />
