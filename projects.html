                Virtual Pet 1 was my first experience with building a simple application. Using Java <br>
                fundamentals, I was able to create a virtual pet in which I could feed, water and play with. <br>
                preforming these tasks would in turn affect the pet's stats. <br>
                <br/>
                Virtual Pet 1 was written in Visual Studio Code using basic concepts such as loops, <br>
                methods, and classes. <br>

                Virtual Pet 2 was built off of Virtual Pet 1. Here I added a shelter class where I could house <br>
                and care for multiple pets as opposed to just one. I also added methods which allowed for adopting out <br> 
                and admitting pets to and from the shelter. <br>
                <br/>
                Virtual Pet 2 was written in Visual Studio Code and introduced the use of new concepts from OOP
                and using collections.

                Virtual Pet API is a simple REST API. Here I created an entity, repository, controller and service <br>
                for virtual pets. Pets were able to be loaded into and located in the database. <br>
                <br/>
                Like Virtual Pet 1 and 2, this project was written in Visual Studio Code. The project was created via <br>
                Spring Initializer and tested using Postman. <br>
